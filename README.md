## General info

This is an example of a responsive landing page. The screen sizes used to this exercise are max-width 1440px and a mobile size of 360px. To do this I used media queries and I have split the css file into more files to try to have more reusability of the code and readability. The main points are :

- Learn HTML and CSS
- Learn how to use flexbox position and media query

I created a dynamic slideshow with javascript.
